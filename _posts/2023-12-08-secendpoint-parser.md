## Hey There, Welcome to the SECEndpoint-parser Project! 👋

I'm Mehrdad, and I love making complex things easy to understand. Today, let's talk about the SECEndpoint-parser project. It's all about making financial data less scary and more friendly.

### Chat Bot: Your Financial Buddy 🤖

First up, we've got this cool chat bot. It's like having a smart friend who knows a lot about finance. You ask questions, and it gives you clear, easy answers.

### Data Wrangling: Making Sense of Numbers 🧮

We use this neat tool, `FinancialDataProcessor`, to sort out messy financial data. Think of it as a super-organized librarian who knows exactly where every piece of information should go.

### SQL Queries: Finding the Needle in the Haystack 🔍

In the world of `apps/queries`, we've got these SQL queries. They're like detectives, finding the exact financial info we need from a huge pile of data.

### Chat Interface: Just Like Texting 📱

Our chat interface is super user-friendly. It's pretty much like texting with someone who can give you the lowdown on financial stuff in a snap.

### Logging Manager: Keeping Track of Things 📝

Over in `LoggingManager`, there's a logging manager. It's like a meticulous journal keeper, making sure we remember every step we take with the data.

### Setting Things Up: Building Blocks 🏗️

The backbone of our project is in `SnowflakeDataManager`. It's like setting up a really secure and organized place to keep all our important financial data.

### The Handy Helpers: Utilities 🔧

In `utils`, we've got these handy tools that help us keep everything running smoothly. They're the unsung heroes making sure every bit of data is where it should be.

### So, What's This All About? 🌍

Imagine we're turning a jungle of financial data into a nice, neat garden. That's what SECEndpoint-parser is all about.

Come join me on this adventure at Capitabyte. We're not just playing with numbers; we're making them easy and fun to understand.

Hop on board, and let's explore the world of finance together, one byte at a time!
